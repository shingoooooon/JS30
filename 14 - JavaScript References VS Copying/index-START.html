    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let team = players

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team[3] = "Yeah";

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = "aaaaa";

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let team3 = [...players];
    team3[3] = "bbbb"

    let team4 = Array.from(players);
    team4[3] = "ccc";

    console.log(players);
    console.log(team4);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    console.clear();
    const dev = person;
    // dev.name = "me";

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const dev2 = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'shingo', age:28})

    console.log(person);
    console.log(dev2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
